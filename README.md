# Calories predictor

**This project deals with predicting the calories burn by different people using XGBoost Regressor model.**

We work on two datasets, one containing the data of different people, i.e exercices.csv and another containing calories burnt by them, i.e. calories.csv

Towards the end we were able to predict the calories burnt using the data given and compared with given calories data, with Mean Absolute Error of 1.4, which is quite accurate.
